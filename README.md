**`Worldbuiler (Technologist/Bookworm/Champ)`**

I am a 1C Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo interning at NSI as a DevOps Engineer. With a passion for anything and allthings technology, keep tabs on my github because you will see some **super dope stuff** in the coming weeks, months, and years.
